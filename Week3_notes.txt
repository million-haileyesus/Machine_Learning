f(W,b)(X) = W dot product X + b

z = W dot product X + b


g(z) = 1 / (1 + e ^ (-z))


f(W,b)(X) = g(W dot product X + b) = 1 / (1 + e ^ (-(W dot product X + b)))



Decision boundary

f(W,b)(X) = W dot product X + b

z = W dot product X + b


g(z) = 1 / (1 + e ^ (-z))


Non-linear decision boundaries

g(z) = g(w1x1^(2) + w2x2^(2) + b) => The graph for this would be a circle
