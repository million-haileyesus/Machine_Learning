f(x) = m*x + b
f(x) is y, x is x, m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

To find the slope using the graph you calculate rise divided by run.



Cost function or Squared error cost function: (y_hat - y) = error
				sum from i = 1 to m ((y_hat(i) - y(i))^2) => Total square error
				m = number of training examples

			If we don't want get bigger as the training size gets bigger we divided it by m to get the average.
