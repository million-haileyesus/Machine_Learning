# Fruit Classification using Machine Learning

This repository contains a variety of machine learning approaches for fruit classification. The techniques implemented include:

- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Clustering Methods**
- **Simple Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
- **Transfer Learning**
  - Feature Extraction
  - Forward Hook
  - Fine-Tuning

Each approach is organized into separate sections and is accompanied by the necessary scripts and documentation to facilitate understanding and replication of the results.
